## Data Science Projects

#### Kaggle Competitions
- [Quora Insincere Question Classification](https://github.com/kammybdeng/quora-insincere-question)
  - Built and optimized multiple LSTM, GRU, and Naive Bayes models to classify whether a Quora question is insincere. Composed a Github write-up on the project progress and results.

- [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://github.com/kammybdeng/jigsaw-unintended-bia)
  - Improved models that had been incorrectly learned to associate the names of frequently attacked identities with toxicity

#### Case Studies and Personal Projects
- [Traveling recommender](https://github.com/kammybdeng/travel-time-rec) (Recommender and website)
	- Analyzed and transformed 1,000+ TripAdviser text reviews, star ratings, and personality scores. Utilized PySpark's ALS matrix factorization algorithm to build a collaborative filtering recommender. Developed a local web application for the model in PySpark and Flask.
- [Analytics Case Study](https://github.com/kammybdeng/churn-analysis-case-study) (Business Impacts)
