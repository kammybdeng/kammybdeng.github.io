- Inquisitive, optimistic, and adaptive  
- I enjoy traveling and exploring new places when I'm not working!

## Me in 30 seconds
- Developed my interest in Data Science from my first ever CS class during my sophomore year.
- Yet, I was too afraid to switch to my major because I was scared that I would not excel in a subject that I'm not familiar with.
- Worked as an accounting specialist and found out that I really don't enjoy the job so I decided to give it a shot while I'm still young.
