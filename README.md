This repository is mainly used as my own reference for interview preparation. However, if you find it helpful or interesting, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn for any questions or comments!

You can build a wordcloud too! See my code [here](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/extra/wordcloud.py).

## Data Science Concepts

### Data Science Concepts (in progress)
Practical business concepts of data problems.

[Data Science Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/general_notes/Data_Science_notes.ipynb)

### Statistical Concepts (in progress)
Statistics is often used to generate inference hypothesis in our data.

[Statistical Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/Stats%20Concepts.ipynb)

### Probability Modelings (in progress)
Probability is the fundamentals of Statistics. By understanding the behavior of the data distributions, we can justify our methods of statistical analysis.
