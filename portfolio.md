## Data Science Concepts

- [General Data Science Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/general_notes/Data_Science_notes.ipynb)
  - Practical business concepts of data problems (**under development**).

- [Statistics](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/Stats%20Concepts.ipynb)
  - Statistics is often used to generate inference hypothesis in our data (**under development**).

- [Probability Modeling](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/probability%20simulations.ipynb)
  - Probability is the fundamentals of Statistics. By understanding the behavior of the data distributions, we can justify our methods of statistical analysis (**under development**).
