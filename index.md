## Data Science Concepts

### Data Science Concepts (in progress)
Practical business concepts of data problems.

[Data Science Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/general_notes/Data_Science_notes.ipynb)

### Statistical Concepts (in progress)
Statistics is often used to generate inference hypothesis in our data.

[Statistical Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/Stats%20Concepts.ipynb)

### Probability Modelings (in progress)
Probability is the fundamentals of Statistics. By understanding the behavior of the data distributions, we can justify our methods of statistical analysis.
