<!-- ## Data Science Concepts

- [General Data Science Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/general_notes/Data_Science_notes.ipynb)
  - Practical business concepts of data problems (**under development**).

- [Statistics](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/Stats%20Concepts.ipynb)
  - Statistics is often used to generate inference hypothesis in our data (**under development**).

- [Probability Modeling](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/probability%20simulations.ipynb)
  - Probability is the fundamentals of Statistics. By understanding the behavior of the data distributions, we can justify our methods of statistical analysis (**under development**).

## Database and SQL

- [Database Explained](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/database-explained.ipynb)
  - Data Scientists often interact with SQL and other database systems.
- [SQL Exercises](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/sql_exercises.ipynb)


## More practices
- [Take home repository](https://github.com/kammybdeng/take-home-practices)
  - A repository consists of take home exercises from the book, "A collection of Data Science Take-homes.

- [Python Challenges](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/python%20challenge/Python%20challenges.ipynb)
  - Python Challenges from leetcode, codewar and more. -->
