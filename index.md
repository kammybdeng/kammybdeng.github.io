## Welcome

Welcome to my website. I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at Evisort specializing in designing, building, and optimizing NLP and classification models.

I'm currently self-learning Django by doing small projects. A [blog sharing webapp](https://github.com/kammybdeng/blogsite) and a CMS (Content Management System) [courses webapp](https://github.com/kammybdeng/educa). You are welcome to check out my progress!
